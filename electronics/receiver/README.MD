This is the proposed design for the Receiver PCB including Low Noise Amplifier, Band Pass Filter and PIN diode switching.
The band pass filter is 4 pole butterworth with 1dB bandwidth of 144.0 to 147.0 MHz.  It is switched between receive and transmit paths. 
The low noise amplifier has a 2dB noise figure.  It has protection against antenna relay leakage and close by transmitters.  It has a gain of 25dB.  Provision is made to attenuate the Receiver gain by 15 dB and 30dB to optimse strong signal performance.
PIN diode switching is provided for Receive/Transmit switching.  A monitor channel is provided to allow the LimeSDR receiver to monitor the attenuated transmit signal.
